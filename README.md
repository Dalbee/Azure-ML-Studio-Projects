# Azure-ML-Studio-Projects
OBJECTIVE:
Sale Price Prediction using Azure Machine Learning Studio with Excel API integration that help you predict house prices based on machine learning algorithm (K-means Clustering). 
1. Create a Machine Learning Model with Azure Machine Learning Studio
   - Explore and visualize datasets with python in jupyter notebooks.
   - Use Zscore Transformation method to Normalize data.
   - Train a regression model (supervised learning)
   - Evaluate Model
2. Publish trained model to a webservice and use it to predict labels from new feature data.
   - Deploy the web service
   - Consume the web service with excel
3. Train a classification model (supervised learning) in Azure Machine learning studio
4. Train a clustering model (Unsupervised learning)
   - copy an existing training experiment from the Azure AI Gallery and run it to train a K-Means clustering model that segments specific customers into clusters based on similarities in their features
